# Vue Atom Snippets

## Description

This package is an Atom port of the excellent [`Ride VSCode Snippets`](https://github.com/Wavesafrica/waves-ride-snippets) by Waves Africa.

The goals of this package are:

* To remain compatible with the `waves-ride-snippets` - all prefixes from the original repository should be available and should produce the same output.

* Implement Atom-specific tweaks and improvements which can help productivity.

* The package does not aim to become an "ubermegablob" of snippets but rather focus on parts which are useful in every day code work.

* The scope of the snippets is the core ecosystem around Waves Ride.

## Plugin installation

`apm install waves-ride-atom-snippets`

## Availability

The snippets provided by the plugin will be available in all **.ride** files.
